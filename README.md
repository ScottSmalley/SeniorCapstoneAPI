# SeniorCapstoneAPI

FlexPoolAPI:
Formatted to be uploaded as an AWS Lambda function, it checks an HTTPRequest message body for a JSON object. Inside 
the object, there must be an "action" key/value pair with a value corresponding to an action for the API to perform.
Depending on the "action" sent, the API returns either a message of success / failure or data.
